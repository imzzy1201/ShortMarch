- [x] Base: Implement a path tracing algorithm that correctly handles diffuse and specular materials. (**basic**)
- [x] Scene creation: Build a custom scene with aesthetic considerations, using geometry that you create from scratch or find online (ensure the source is credited). (**basic**, tidiness and attractiveness 1pt)
- [x] Acceleration structure: Implement an acceleration structure such as BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy). This is not required for hardware-based renderers, as the acceleration structure is built-in in that case. (**basic**, Surface Area Heuristic or another advanced algorithm 2pts)
- [ ] Material: Create a (non-trivial) custom material. Options include:
  - [x] Transmissive material (**basic**)
  - [x] Principled BSDF (2pts)
  - [x] Multi-layer material (2pts)
  - [ ] Rendering of fur, hair, skin, etc. (2pts)
- [ ] Texture: Create your own (non-trivial) texture with proper texture mapping. Options include
  - [x] Color texture (**basic**)
  - [ ] Normal map, height map, attribute map, or any functional texture mapping (1pt for each, up to 2pts)
  - [ ] Implement an adaptive mipmap algorithm (2pts)
- [x] Importance Sampling: Use more advanced sampling algorithms for path tracing. (Importance sampling with Russian Roulette, multiple importance sampling 2pts)
- [ ] Volumetric Rendering: Options include:
  - [x] Subsurface scattering (2pts)
  - [x] Homogeneous volume rendering (1pt)
  - [ ] Inhomogeneous volume rendering (1pt)

  - [x] Point light and area light (**basic**)
  - [x] Environment lighting with HDR, such as skybox (2pts)
- [x] Anti-aliasing: Implement an anti-aliasing algorithm (**basic**)
